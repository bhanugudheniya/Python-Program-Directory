# A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times

# Types of Loops
-> for   : Executes a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.

    Syntax:

    l = [1,2,3]
    for i in l:
        print(i)    #print- 1,2,3

-> while : while loop is used to execute a block of statements repeatedly until a given a condition is satisfied.
           And when the condition becomes false, the line immediately after the loop in program is executed.
           In this, condition is checked first, if it evaluates to true, the body of the loop is executed, otherwise not.

    Syntax:

    while condition:
        #Body
