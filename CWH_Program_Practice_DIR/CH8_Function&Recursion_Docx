Function : It is a group of statement performing a specific task. A function can be reused by the programmer in a given
program any number ot times.

Ex :
def func1():
    print("Hello")


Function Call : Whenever we want to call a function, we put the name of the function followed by parenthesis as follows:
    func1()   -> function call

Function Definition : The part containing the exact set of instructions which are executed during the function call.

>> Type of function:
1. Built in function : print(), range(), sum(), len(), pop(), etc...
2. User define function : func1, or user choice..


# Function Arguments : A function can accept some values it can work with. We can put these values in the parenthesis.
A function can also return values as shown below:

def greet(name):
    gr = ("Hello" + name)
    return gr

a = greet("Bhanu")     --> "Bhanu" is passed to greet in name
|-> 'a' will not contain 'Hello Bhanu'


# Default Parameter Value : If we specify name = "Stranger" int the line containing def, this value is used when no
argument is passed.
Eg:
   def greet(name="Stranger"):
        # function body
   greet()  -> Name will be 'stranger' in function body(default)
   greet('bhanu')  -> Name will be 'bhanu' in function body(passed)


# Recursion : Recursion is a function which calls itself. It is used to directly use a mathematical formula as a
function.

Eg:
    def factorial(n):
        if i == 0 or i == 1:        # Base condition which doesn't call the function any further
            return 1
        else:
            return n * factorial(n-1)       # Function calling itself
--- Working ---

factorial(4)    # function calling
    |
   \ /
 4 * factorial(3)
 4 * [3 * factorial(2)]
 4 * 3 * [2 * factorial(1)]
 4 * 3 * 2 * [1] [function return]
