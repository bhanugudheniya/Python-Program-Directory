File : It is a data stored in a storage device. A python program can talk to the file by reading content from it and
writing content to it.

Type of file:
1. Text file (.txt, .c, etc..)
2. Binary File (.pg, .dat, etc..)

Function : Reading, Updating, Deleting, Writing, Appending.

>> Opening a file : open() --> open('file_name', 'mode')

>> Reading a file : f = open('file_name', 'r')
                    text = f.read()
                    print(text)
                    f.close()   #close file

print no. of character --> f.read(2)

readline() --> read one line from the file

Modes:
1. r  --> open for reading
2. w  --> open for writing
3. a  --> open for appending
4. +  --> open for updating

'rb' will open for read in binary mode
'rt' will open for read in text mode

>> With Statement : Close the file automatically

    with open('file_name') as f:
        f.read()  # don't need to write f.close(), it is done automatically
